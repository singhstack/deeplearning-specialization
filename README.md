** Please note, I programmed this notebook as a part of my assignment in deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization on coursera during the winter of 2018-19.

1. This particular project uses Neural Networks to identify the hand sign (numbers from 0-5) in an image using Neural Networks & TensorFlow.

2. The Neural Net uses 2 Hidden Layers in addition to an input layer and a Softmax Output layer. [LINEAR->RELU->RELU->LINEAR]

3. Dataset being used for training and test is the SIGNS Dataset provided in the course 'Improving Deep Neural Networks - Tuning Hyperparameter, Regularization and Optimization'.

4. I did this project as a part of the above mentioned course on Coursera.


Cheers!
