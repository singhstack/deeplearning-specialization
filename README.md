# neural-net-projects
This particular project uses Deep Neural Networks to identify the hand sign (numbers from 0-5) in an image using Neural Networks & TensorFlow.
The Neural Net uses 2 Hidden Layers in addition to an input layer and a Softmax Output layer. [LINEAR->RELU->RELU->LINEAR]
Dataset being used for training and test is the SIGNS Dataset provided in the course 'Improving Deep Neural Networks - Tuning Hyperparameter, Regularization and Optimization'.
This project was done as a part of the above mentioned course on Coursera.
I will upload an extended version of the project covering all alphabets and additional hadn symbols.

Cheers!
